The German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) is offering scholarships to support Master's and PhD studies for individuals
in Sub-Saharan Africa. This initiative aims to strengthen higher education systems in the region, contributing to
sustainable development. The scholarships are intended for those aspiring to pursue careers in teaching and research at
higher education institutions within Sub-Saharan Africa.

<br>
The program primarily targets university staff but also addresses the broader need for academically trained
professionals in the public sector. Female candidates and applicants from less privileged regions or groups are
especially encouraged to apply.
