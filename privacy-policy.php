    <h5>5. How We Protect Your Information</h5>
    At MK Scholars, we prioritize the security of your personal information and are committed to ensuring that your data remains protected. We understand how crucial it is to keep your information safe, which is why we implement several security measures to safeguard your privacy. To begin with, we use advanced encryption technologies to secure sensitive data, such as payment details, while it is being transmitted across the internet. This helps ensure that your information is not exposed to unauthorized parties during the transmission process.
    <br><br>
    In addition to encryption, our website and database are hosted on secure servers, which are designed to prevent unauthorized access to your data. These servers are equipped with advanced security protocols to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of the information stored on them. Furthermore, we have established strict policies regarding employee access to personal data. Only authorized employees who have been trained in handling sensitive information are allowed access to your data, and they are required to follow the highest standards of privacy and confidentiality.
    <br><br>
    While we take all necessary precautions to protect your data, it is important to note that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage can be considered 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee absolute security but remain committed to maintaining the highest level of protection available.
