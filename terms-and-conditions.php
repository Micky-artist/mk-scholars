This staged payment option makes our services more accessible and allows you to manage your financial commitments effectively while progressing through your application journey.
<br><br>

Cancellation of Services<br>

In the event that you decide to discontinue the application process at any point, please be aware that fees already paid for completed services are non-refundable. This policy reflects the time, expertise, and resources invested by our team up to the stage of service delivery. For instance, if you have received assistance with essay writing or interview coaching before deciding to halt the process, those fees will not be refunded.
